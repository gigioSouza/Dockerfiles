Docker Image based in [my fork of CMAK](https://github.com/gigioSouza/CMAK/tree/3.0.0.5-zk3.4.13)

Due the problem detailed in the [issue#748](https://github.com/yahoo/CMAK/issues/748), I followed the [suggestion to rebuild with my specific zookeeper version as dependency](https://github.com/yahoo/CMAK/issues/748#issuecomment-680670939).

And generated the [3.0.0.5 for Zookeeper 3.4.13](https://github.com/gigioSouza/CMAK/releases/tag/3.0.0.5-zk3.4.13) release.
